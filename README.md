# 100DaysOfCode With React
I got everything set up and ready for this exercise on the 13th of April. But before now i have already started learning somethings about react such as Components, Props, State and eventHandling.


# Day 1: 14th April
I am looking at React state. State can be managed with a component, onlike props states can be changes using the useState hooks. States can be used in function components by calling useState hook. While states can be access in class components by calling this.state.
