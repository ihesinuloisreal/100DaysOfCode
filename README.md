# 100DaysOfCode With React
I got everything set up and ready for this exercise on the 13th of April. But before now i have already started learning somethings about react such as Components, Props, State and eventHandling.


# Day 1: 14th April
I am looking at React state. State can be managed with a component, onlike props states can be changes using the useState hooks. States can be used in function components by calling useState hook. While states can be access in class components by calling this.state. 

# Day 2: 15th April
Today i am taking a closer look on setState in the react class component. I created a button that increaments a count by 1 after it is clicked. I also looked at how to set actions that are dependent on a states that is to be set using a callback function. And i looked at incrementing our count 5 times with a click. Basically react state can be set in two ways which are. Object passing which can include a callback function, and Function which can be used used when you need to update a state bassed on the previouse state.
