# 100DaysOfCode With React
I got everything set up and ready for this exercise on the 13th of April. But before now i have already started learning somethings about react such as Components, Props, State and eventHandling.


# Day 1: 14th April
I am looking at React state. State can be managed with a component, onlike props states can be changes using the useState hooks. States can be used in function components by calling useState hook. While states can be access in class components by calling this.state. 

# Day 2: 15th April
Today i am taking a closer look on setState in the react class component. I created a button that increaments a count by 1 after it is clicked. I also looked at how to set actions that are dependent on a states that is to be set using a callback function. And i looked at incrementing our count 5 times with a click. Basically react state can be set in two ways which are. Object passing which can include a callback function, and Function which can be used used when you need to update a state bassed on the previouse state.

# Day 3: 16th April
Today I am looking at distructuring props and state. Destructuring props is an ES6 feature that make it possible to unpack values from arrays or properties from object into disting variables. we have two ways to distructure props in a functional component. Today i Appied the knowleged of passing props into passing states and i was able to create a button functional component, and passed in state into it from a class component.

I was able to pass in states and props into a single button components

# Day 4: 17th April
Today i am looking at Event Handling in react. Event in react must be camel case e.g, onClick.

# Day 5: 18th April
How to bind Event Handlers. there are four way we can bind events, which are 
1. Binding in Render 
2. Arrow Function 
3. Binding in the class constructor 
4. Class property as Arrow function
But the best practice involve approche 3 and 4.

Today i added an event listiner to listing to each button click

# Day 6: 19th April
Method passing as props. This process can be used to communicate with the parent element from the child element. To achieve that communication from the child component, we use an Arrow function in the return statemen. Arrow function syntax is the simples way to pass parameter from the child component to the parent component.
